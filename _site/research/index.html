<h1>Research Areas</h1>
My major research interests are in the areas of software engineering and computing education. I also work on the intersection of the two fields. I will discuss some sample research interest below.
<h2> Computing Education</h2>
Computing education research is a discipline-based research that aims to make new discoveries about  teaching and learning. The research covers a wide area including software engineering, cybersecurity, AI, data, ethics, psychology of learning, ethics, informaion, and so on. My work in this field includes: investigating strategies to teach a large and diverse class, analysis of program written by novice programmers, and analysis of learner's discussion on social media platforms.
<h2>Software Evolution</h2>
Change is constant, and software engineering artifacts are continuosly updated due to changing requirements, new fetures, bug fixing, and so on. The changes applied to software artifacts might have a lot of unintended effects like introducing new errors, break dependencies, increase in code complexities, and so on. Overtime, these changes become complex, the rationale behind the changes are lost, and it may become more challenging to fix or update them to modern standards. My research explores novel approaches for investigating these changes such as stdying the impact of software changes, understanding the rationale behind the changes, and automated classification of these changes.
<h2>Analysis of System Models</h2>
System models such as MATLAB/Simulink or LabVIEW are widely used by traditional engineers (e.g., Electrical or Mechanical Engineers) to develop software in diverse domains. However, existing research shows that most of these engineers may not be familiar with software engineering research and tends to prioritize correctness over other properties (e.g readability, adaptation to changing requirements) that affects the maintenance of the developed software in the long term. This leads to increase in maintenance cost and the introduction of design defects in the software. This research aims to analyse changes across the version history  of exisiting LabVIEW and Simulink models in GitHub repositories with the goal of reducing the design defects via appropriate recommendations to engineers developing software with both LabVIEW and Simulink,
<h2>Modeling Tools as a Service</h2>
Traditional modeling tools are often delivered as a software package that need to be installed locally or as part of a distributed software e.g eclipse plugin. Due to the complexities of these tools, they often require non-trivial configurations and inter-dependencies. This makes them hard to install, update and maintain. This local installation of these tools also limits the reuse of modeling artifacts consumed by them and new artifacts need to be built from scratch every time. Recently, there has been a lot of migration of software products to the cloud which helps remove the complexities of local maintenance and also helps to harness the computing power in the cloud. The aim of this project is to develop novel and optimal ways by which modeling tools can be migrated to the cloud and its functionalities delivered as a service.
<h2>Model-Driven Engineering</h2>
Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is a disruptive approach to software engineering whereby models are used as first class artifacts in software development in order to boost productivity. These models are manipulated by model management programs that need to be tested (because they are software and can develop bugs!) in order to boost confidence in their correctness. To test these programs, appropriate models that satisfy necessary constraints are required as test data. Models have inherently complex structures and are often required to satisfy non-trivial constraints which makes them time consuming, labour intensive and error prone to construct manually. Automated capabilities are therefore required, however, existing fully-automated model generation tools cannot generate models that satisfy arbitrarily complex constraints. This project addresses this problem by developing a framework that supports the development of model generators that can produce random and reproducible test models that satisfy complex constraints.
